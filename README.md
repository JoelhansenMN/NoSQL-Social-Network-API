# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description
For this challenge was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. This application uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, it also uses JavaScript date library [Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)to format timestamps.

Since this application isn’t deployed, there is also a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the working routes. Please see the link below
